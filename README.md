# Machine_Learning

Boosting algorithms implement a sequential process where each model attempts to correct the mistakes of the previous models. The idea is to convert many weak learners into one strong learner. 

Gradient Boosting employs the gradient descent algorithm to minimize errors in sequential models. The major inefficiency in Gradient Boosting is that it creates one decision tree at a time.
